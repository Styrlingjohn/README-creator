# Title
Styrling's Project

## Description
The README generator uses a NPM package called, inquirer, to use the terminal as a communication command line where questions can be asked and answered can be stored. In this specific prooject, we are answering questions that will building a README.md file to our repository. The user can use the terminal to answer all the questions and the program will generate the README.md file. I have learned how versatile the nodule-modules can be used and how to incorporate them with Javascript to create a program. I have also learned how much cleaner my index.js page can look if I utilize module.export for other code references.
